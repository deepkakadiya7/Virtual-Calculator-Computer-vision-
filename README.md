# Virtual Calculator Using Computer Vision

This project is a **Virtual Calculator** built with Python, OpenCV, and cvzone's HandTrackingModule. It detects hand gestures via a webcam to perform calculator operations virtually, without physical button presses.

## 🚀 Features
- Real-time hand tracking using OpenCV and cvzone
- Click detection based on finger distance
- Basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /)
- Clean, intuitive virtual interface
